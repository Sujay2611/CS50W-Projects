        <p>Big three have pretty much dominated tennis for the last 15 years. Together they have won 56 of the last 67 grand slams played from 2003 till 2020. All 3 of them have different strengths and weaknesses, excel on different surfaces. They have played some of their best tennis against each other. All 3 are great blocks on and off the court.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Novak Djokovic vs Roger Federer, Wimbledon 2019 Final</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This was a gruelling 5 set match which went right down to the wire. Novak ended up winning in the final set tiebreak. Might turn out to be Roger's final chance to add to his grand slam tally.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
        <li>Novak Djokovic vs Rafael Nadal, Australian Open 2012 Final</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This was a titanic affair which lasted almost 6 hours. Both players were at peak of their powers during those days. Ultimately Novak won in 5 sets.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
        <li>Stan Wawrinka vs Novak Djokovic, French open 2015 Final</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This match included some of the best ball striking I have ever seen on a tennis court. Stan completely outgunned and outmuscled novak in all departments and won Roland Garros in an astonishing fashion.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
        <li>Daniil Medvedev vs Rafael Nadal, US Open 2019 Final</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This match was about an in form up and coming youngster taking on 1 of the big three and taking him all the way to the 5th set in his first ever grand slam final. Eventhough Rafa won the match in the end Medvedev showed that he has the game and the mental toughness to win grand slams in the near future.</li>
